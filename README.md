# Geo-Mapping-of-Entities-Using-BERT
This project aims to build a model that enables researchers to make quantitative arguments about environmental awareness and cultural change. The dataset has been taken from reddit and scholarly articles which contains the data from local news of the region for which we are analyzing the environmental changes. We will be using an open-sourced neural network-based technique for Natural Language Processing called BERT which has been pre-trained on the whole English Wikipedia and can be further fine-tuned on smaller task-specific datasets.
